# Regression Analysis

This section contains the cleaned [dataset](https://github.com/FEDSCornell/GlobalFoodDollar/raw/master/Analysis/RegressionAnalysis/Data/farm%20share%2C%20WB%2C%20FAO.dta) and [Stata code](GFDRegression.do) of creating regression results (table S4 in the supplementary materials)

- The [Stata dataset](https://github.com/FEDSCornell/GlobalFoodDollar/raw/master/Analysis/RegressionAnalysis/Data/farm%20share%2C%20WB%2C%20FAO.dta) is developed for the regression analysis. 

- [STATA code](GFDRegression.do) can be used to replicate the regression analysis in table S4. 

#### Instructions:

 1. Please download the [zipped file](https://github.com/FEDSCornell/GlobalFoodDollar/raw/master/Analysis/RegressionAnalysis/Data/farm%20share%2C%20WB%2C%20FAO.dta), uncompress it to have the "Data" folder in your working directory.

 2. Make sure that the working directory is specified properly in the "cd" command (included in the [STATA code](Analysis/RegressionAnalysis/GFDRegression.do).
